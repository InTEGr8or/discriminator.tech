Discriminating between ethics is a life choice.

A person owns their own life, and so are the proper chooser of their daily life choices:
    1. What to think about next.
    2. What to focus your eyes on.
    3. What to do with your hands.
    4. Where to go.

Because you are an animal, you are animated. You move, and you can only chose one motion option. For instance, you can only move forward OR backwards, OR to not move. You can't choose all three options and carry out that choice simultaneously. You have to choose BETWEEN available options.

A large number of people find this fact unbearable. Even if they have 10 billion options to choose from they will complain about being "forced" to decide. They'll decry the either-or binary dochotomy as a "prison" of rationality that you're trying to trap them in to remove their "liberty" of choosing something non-existent. Artists and authors are particurly noisy about this, because they think it's their job to produce something outside of existing reality, something "totally new" and unrelated to anything that exists.
