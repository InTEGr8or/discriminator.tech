# Introduction

I don't see where the origin of this HTML Index is. I was converting among a few static site generators and it may have gotten lost. It should also be in index.html in docs/.

## Discriminator

          Discriminator

The Discriminator  
Def: moral differentiation
==============================================

Everyone discriminates. If you're shocked by this statement, and say "I would never discriminate!", that is because _you_ discriminate against discrimination.

Discrimination just means to _judge_ one thing to be good and another to be bad.

Although this list may appear to reflect political groups, that similarity is only circumstantial, local, and temporary. It is important to note, however, that politics must rightfully be based on morality/ethics.

New content will pour into the gray area, and from there be broken down into components so as to be disambiguated and differentiated.

### Bad/Wrong

#### As animated beings we act, and we must choose which action to take. These are the actions to be avoided in practice.

Middle
------

### Indecission

#### The gray (grey?) indeterminite area. This is what the discriminator is designed to exclude.

### Good/Right

#### The goal. The objective. The point of excluding bad actions is to clear the field to achieve what is right and good in life.
