{{< discriminator 
    main="Title of any item to be discriminated" 
    middle="Entry point, to be discriminated, excluded middle" 
    left="To be Left" right="What is right"  >}}

{{< discriminator 
    main="Additional item to be discriminated" 
    middle="Water" 
    left="Too much so as to cause drowning, flooding, mold, demineralization" 
    right="Enough to prevent dehydration, to provide utility, or leasure enjoyment"  >}}

{{< discriminator 
    main="Discriminating discrimination" 
    middle="Discrimination" 
    left="When it produces invalid results" 
    right="When it supports and does not conflict with self-prospering decision-making"  >}}
