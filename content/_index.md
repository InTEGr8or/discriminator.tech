## On invalid descrimination

Discrimination is a process which occurs _inside_ reality, and is therefore subject to scrutiny. That is why this website exists in the `.tech` top-level domain.

## Populism is an invalid form of discrimination

Probably the most destructive idea in politics is the idea that political coordinates are discovered by polling a population of people who self-identify as acribing to that ideal or political agenda.

It would be unlikely to find someone today who would publicly say "slavery used to be a bad thing, but now it is the new form of liberty"

Definitions of words like "authoritarianism" or "totalitarianism" or "tyranny" or "genocide" should not mutate into their opposites.

Neither shold the poles or directions of political ideology.



Rightism means individual rights and politics based on recognition of individual rights, self-ownership, property, speech freedom, freedom from slavery.

Leftism is based on "right to rule", which is fake. Examples are "divine right of kings", "majority rule" or "the dictatorship of the proletariat". The biggest obstacles to Leftism is private property, speech freedoms, self-ownership, freedom from slavery.

This is the only real change in politics in the history of mankind, and it happened most significantly on July 4th, 1776, with many minor examples throughout every event in history.

## Disorientation

People complain about things every day. People fight wars over things. At the same time we hear people complain that the divisions are indistinguishable. 

Why are people fighting wars if they can't differentiate friend or foe?

One current example of disorientations is the suprise media pundits and academics see in "left-wing authoritarianism".

A survey of historical and current fictional narrative finds about zero percent referring to "left-wing authoritarianism".  When authors of such great anti-authoritarian novels as "1984", "Animal Farm", "Darkness at Noon" they express shock at how consistently "right-wing authoritarianism" infiltrates the left-wing.

People complain that the Right and the Left are both authoritarian, and so it doesn't matter which one you favor.

### The Hazzard of Disorientation

But where does that leave us? In democratic societies, we are asked to decide periodically by voting. Voting is recently in the news as being "our most fundamental right", which has  supposedly recently come under attack.

But how can we choose on our ballots if the choices are indistingishable? Of "both sides do it"?
