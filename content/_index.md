Rightism means individual rights and politics based on recognition of individual rights, self-ownership, property, speech freedom, freedom from slavery.

Leftism is based on "right to rule", which is fake. Examples are "divine right of kings", "majority rule" or "the dictatorship of the proletariat". The biggest obstacles to Leftism is private property, speech freedoms, self-ownership, freedom from slavery.

This is the only real change in politics in the history of mankind, and it happened most significantly on July 4th, 1776, with many minor examples throughout every event in history.
